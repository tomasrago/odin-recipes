    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>White sugar</li>
      <li>All-purpose flour</li>
      <li>Cornstarch</li>
      <li>Salt</li>
      <li>Water</li>
      <li>Lemons</li>
      <li>Butter</li>
      <li>Beaten egg yolks</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Directions</h4>
    
    <ol>
      <li><strong>Hot broth. </strong>Keep the broth hot the whole way through. Measure out a little more into the broth pot than the recipe says to make up for evaporation as it sits.</li>
      <li><strong>Toast the rice. </strong>Toast the grains in hot oil until they start to turn translucent around the edges. Stir continuously during this process.</li>
      <li><strong>Stir. </strong>Stir after each half cup of broth you add to make sure the broth is distributed evenly, then stir again every 30 seconds or so until almost all the broth is absorbed. Add another half cup of broth and repeat. </li>
      <li><strong>Temperature. </strong>Keep the broth hot and the risotto at a low simmer throughout.</li>
      <li><strong>Texture. </strong>Risotto is done when the rice is al dente: firm but not crunchy when you bite into it. It should not be as dry as steamed rice, but should have enough liquid to make it loose. </li>
      <li><strong>Serve immediately. </strong>Risotto waits for no one. It will continue to cook as it sits even when it's off the heat, so be prepared to dish it up right away.</li>
    </ol>
